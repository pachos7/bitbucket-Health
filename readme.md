# gitHealthCheck.py

This application helps you determine the relative health of your git Bitbucket repository based on your branching strategy. 
It uses Github branching strategy so it expects a master branch and several features branches.
A system of negatives and positive points is used to give you a generic idea of your repository status.

# Points system
Value | Reason
----- | -------------
+7 | Health starts with a base +7 score
+1 | Having a 'master' branch set as default
+1 | Having commit with prod implementation tag
+1 | Having less than 5 active branches
-1 | Having a 'release','development','integration' named branch
-1 | Having more than 5 active branches
-1 | Each inactive branch (not updated in the last 3 months)
-1 | Having branches prefixed with 'Bugfix', 'Hotfix', 'Release'
-2 | Each merged branch (they should be deleted)
